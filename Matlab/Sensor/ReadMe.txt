These functions provide samples of MATLAB code for implementing an
interface to the PulsON 400 (P400) Ranging and Communications Module
(RCM). The Application Programming Interface (API) Specification
describes the complete set of messages supported by RCM.

The interface uses Ethernet User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets
implemented by instantiating Java classes in MATLAB. It does not require
any special MATLAB toolboxes.

Edit rangingDemo.m and adjust nodeID values as needed, then run rangingDemo from the Matlab command window.
